\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{}Can't decide what to eat? Can't decide where to go with friends? Can't decide what to wear? Can't decide which pupil answers the lesson? Sometimes because of the multiple available options, we need help to decide something. An Application that makes random decisions could help You to do that and ease down. We introducing our new application called \app. The app can generate a number for the inputted interval (for example: number of the item in menu or number of the pupil in the list) or make a decision for the inputted list (for example: decide among ''go to the restaurant'', ''go to the park'', ''go to the cinema'' etc.). Need democratic selection without revealing the names? Multiple users can input their proposals over bluetooth or network and after \app makes a decision, everyone becomes the same result without knowing who wrote the proposal. What You need to do? Simply enter what You want to decide and shake the handy. That's all. Now You have Your answer. It is so simple.
